# Ball_Game
 
A game of a ball in Unity.

For some reason, I could not for the life of me get the bouncing back walls to work, and when trying to add coins, they just decided to not be collected. It's something I'll keep working on beyond the deadline, for my own sake, but this is the best I could do for this assignment.
Supposed to be played on a 1920x1080 resolution, though any 16:9 resolution should work.
